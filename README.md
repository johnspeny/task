## Forgotten Server

This is the [Forgotten Server version](https://github.com/OTCv8/forgottenserver) that worked as it requires [otclient 10.99](https://github.com/johnspeny/task/tree/main/otclient) and the compatible data file is available [here](https://downloads.ots.me/?dir=data/tibia-clients/dat_and_spr). others seem to fail at building stage or if its successful then the client is not available.
